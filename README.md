# TODO
* Renumber tracks after upload
* Move `Load tracks` to the front of the line
* Add random shuffle option to playlist sorter
* When loading tracks, hide the playlists
* When done with the tracks, show the playlists
* Use [Search API|https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/] to find a playlist
* Rearrange more than 100 tracks
  * To fix this, the tracks beyond 100 need to be downloaded in multiple steps, 
    then the playlist needs to be recreated using a call to [Replace a Playlistâ€™s Tracks|https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/replace-playlists-tracks/]
    then multiple calls to [Add Tracks to a Playlist|https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/replace-playlists-tracks/]
* Play songs in place
